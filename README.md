# 🌦️ Weather & Air Pollution Analysis in Pakistan Using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview

This project explores the relationship between meteorological conditions and air pollution levels in Islamabad, Pakistan. It combines data science techniques with machine learning models to analyze environmental trends and predict temperature based on pollutant concentrations. The project reflects my interest in applying computational methods to real-world environmental and bioinformatics challenges.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess weather and pollution data
- Visualize trends and distributions of key environmental variables
- Perform regression and classification tasks using ML models
- Identify feature importance and optimize model performance

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: Local CSV file (`Pakistan Islamabad weather data.csv`)
- **Features**: Temperature, Humidity, NO₂, SO₂, PM2.5, Date, Year
- **Size**: ~1000+ rows (assumed)
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Date formatting and conversion
  - Missing value imputation using column means
  - Feature engineering for classification labels

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python
